4. SCENARIO FLOW & TRIGGERS
Phase I: The Approach (Stealth)
•	The squad starts 200m down-wadi.
•	Challenge: The player must use the Marksman to eliminate 2 sentries on the "High Ground" before they can see the squad moving through the riverbed.
Phase II: The Village (CQB)
•	The squad enters the rural village. The player must choose between a "Silent Breach" (lockpicks/stealth) or a "Dynamic Breach" (explosives).
•	The Hostage: Located in a basement of the largest stone house. The "Inner Circle" (4 enemies) will execute the hostage if they hear a loud breach and the player does not reach the room within 60 seconds.
Phase III: The Extraction (Loud)
•	Once the hostage is secured, the village is alerted.
•	The Chase: The enemy Technical truck will deploy and chase the squad as they retreat back down the Wadi toward their armored vehicle.
•	Support: The player can call in one "Simulated Airstrike" (Precision Guided Munition) to destroy the Technical if they have a clear line of sight.

5. TRAINING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
•	Tactical Discipline: Did the player stay in the shadows of the Wadi cliffs or walk in the open?
•	Communication: Did the player utilize the "Drone Feed" to tag enemies for their AI squad?
•	Resource Management: Were limited flashbangs used effectively during the final room clear?
•	Time-to-Target: Efficiency in reaching the hostage after the first shot is fired.
